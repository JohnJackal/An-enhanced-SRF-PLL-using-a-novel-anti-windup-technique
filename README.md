## Original Paper Name
Improving Synchronization Stability of VSC via Novel Anti-windup Augmented Phase-Locked Loop
## Preface
This paper was originally done in April, 2024, but due to some reason I didn't have the chance to submit it to any journal or conference. What a pity! Since I don't and won't do research in this field, the best way to make sure my work is not done in vain is to make it public and open source. So I decide to upload the paper with all the diagrams and simulation files to a github repo.
This work focuses on the SRF-PLL control strategy, trying to improve its synchronization stability by introducing some novel anti-windup technique which is called "performance-activation anti-windup". Grid-connected Voltage-Source Converter (VSC) is chosen to be the research scenario. The result is fantastic in my own view, and I hope it can help some future researchers.
## Notification
All simulation is done on MATLAB/SIMULINK 2023b. If you want to reuse the simulink file, make sure you have a compatible MATLAB distribution installed on your PC/Workstation/Laptop.
