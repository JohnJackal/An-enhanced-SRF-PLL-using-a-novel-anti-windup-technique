  abstract = {This paper investigates the tracking control problem of multi-input and multi-output nonlinear systems simultaneously considering the user-specified tracking performance, the asymmetric input saturation, and external disturbances. By introducing the modification signals into the user-specified performance functions, we propose a flexible performance-based control scheme, featuring the capability of avoiding the violation of the resulted modified performance functions (MPFs) due to the input saturation. These modification signals are associated with input saturation errors (the errors between the actual and desired control inputs) and generated by a novel auxiliary system in which all the states are guaranteed to be nonnegative. Consequently, the MPF can degrade the user-specified tracking performance when saturation happens and can recover it when no saturation occurs. Furthermore, the disturbance observer is utilized to estimate external disturbances and relieve the burden on the selection of control gains. With the developed control scheme, it is theoretically shown that the output can always track the reference signal and satisfy the constraints of the MPFs. Finally, the numerical simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.}

These methods are based on the concept of a maximal Lyapunov function, which is introduced in this paper. A partial differential equation characterizing a maximal Lyapunov function is derived, and the relationships of this equation as compared to Zubov's partial differential equation are discussed. An iterative procedure is given for solving the new partial differential equation. This procedure yields Lyapunov function candidates that are rational functions rather than polynomials. The method is applied to four two-dimensional examples and one three-dimensional example, and it is shown that the estimates obtained using this method are, in many cases, substantially better than those obtained using known methods.}

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a performance-based activation mechanism for anti-windup compensation. The signals representing the transient performance of the closed-loop system are passed through a static performance compensator and then injected into the traditional anti-windup activation module and a performance-based anti-windup design framework is developed. The resulting equivalent controller contains the information of the anti-windup compensator and has the potential for improving the performance of the closed-loop systems. Under this new anti-windup design framework, sufficient conditions are established for estimating the domain of attraction and the nonlinear L2 gain of saturated systems. Based on these conditions, we formulate optimization problems to determine the optimal gains of anti-windup and performance compensators for enlarging the domain of attraction and reducing the nonlinear L2 gain. Simulation results show that, compared with the existing methods, our proposed approach has the ability to acquire a significantly larger estimate of the domain of attraction, a significantly tighter estimate of the nonlinear L2 gain, and significantly higher transient quality in reference tracking.}

abstract = {Wind power generation is making an increasingly significant contribution to global electricity production. The high penetration of wind power greatly affects the stability of modern power systems. Recently, new-type stability has been defined for power systems with high-penetration power electronic interfaced technologies (including wind power generation). Moreover, it has been widely reported that the classical types of stability have been altered significantly because of the extensive use of power electronic interfaced technologies. This great transformation presents new challenges to the modeling of power system dynamic behaviors. In the past two decades, extensive research on wind turbine generator modeling has been carried out both by academia and industry, and fruitful results have been achieved. However, comprehensive surveys on a wide range of modeling needs and the applicability of existing modeling methods to current various types of stability studies have received less attention in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview on wind turbine generator modeling for various stability studies. Considering the aspects of time scale, disturbance size, stability study methodology, and modeling methodology, a broad classification of models is presented to distinguish the modeling needs in various stability studies. A conceptual modeling framework is established to address how to custom-tailor an appropriate model for specific types of stability studies. Moreover, the achievements made in various aspects of modeling are comprehensively reviewed. A number of unresolved issues are identified, in particular toward the new-type stability studies, and future research trends are also discussed.}

A simple condition is derived in terms of an auxiliary feedback matrix for determining if a given ellipsoid is contractively invariant. This condition is shown to be less conservative than the existing conditions which are based on the circle criterion or the vertex analysis. Moreover, the condition can be expressed as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) in terms of all the varying parameters and hence can easily be used for controller synthesis. This condition is then extended to determine the invariant sets for systems with persistent disturbances. LMI based methods are developed for constructing feedback laws that achieve disturbance rejection with guaranteed stability requirements. The effectiveness of the developed methods is illustrated with examples.}
